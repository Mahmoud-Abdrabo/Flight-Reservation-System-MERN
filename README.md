<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project is all about an online airline reservation system, through our website a guest could search for flights, get informed about the prices and available seats, however a user can reserve, edit his reservation, pay in addition to everything a guest can do.
This project is for a university course, alongside this what motivated us to put effort in it is that it enhanced our skills and made us more aware of github and MERN STACK.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
on the beginning of every sprint we met, divided the work and divided ourselves 2 groups, group of 3 and group of 2 and each member of the group worked in parallel with the other member.
we used to join a zoom meeting everyday night for an hour or two to follow up with our work and discuss problems and try solve them.
By the end of each sprint we always join everything together make some last changes and submit.
